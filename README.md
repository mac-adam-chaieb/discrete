# Math::Discrete [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mac-adam-chaieb/discrete.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/mac-adam-chaieb/discrete)

A library and DSL for discrete mathematical structures and algorithms

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'discrete'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install discrete

## Feature List

This project is a work in progress and more structures and algorithms will be implemented:

Structures:
- [ ] Sets (finite and infinite)
- [ ] Set Comprehensions (for sets of all other constructs)
- [ ] Logic Propositions (first-order and second-order)
- [ ] Specific Graphs (Bipratite, Directed, Trees, etc...)
- [ ] Graph Constructs (paths)
- [ ] Natural numbers and Integer numbers
- [ ] Mappings (injections, surjections, bijections between two sets)

Algorithms:

- [ ] Graph algorithms: search, traversal, colouring
- [ ] Approximation algorithms
- [ ] Optimization algorithms

## Usage

Work In Progress.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
